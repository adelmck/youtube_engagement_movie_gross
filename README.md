Questions?/Hypothesis


  Can youtube views on a movie trailer be used to predict the future box office performance of the movie?
      
      Views can be used as a predictor of box office performance.
  
  Are the likes on the videos in any way correlated to its future performance?
      
      Likes can be used as a better predictor because likes can't be used in ads of video only when the user seeks the video out through search, trending or recommended.
    
  Are comments on a movie trailer a Key Performance Index on the movie's performance?
      
      No comment count won't predict the movie gross since comments can mean a movie is controversial (good or bad) or has a rabid fan base that argues in comment section.
